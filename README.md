### Description

Adopt Dont Shop is an application written in Ruby on Rails that walks a user through an animal adoption process. As a user you can create an account and move throughout the provided shelters viewing each pet within the shelters. You have the option to view average ratings and full reviews of the shelters as well as the location of each shelter. Each pet has their own picture and description and an option to favorite. If you find a pet to your liking you can apply to adopt. If approved the pet is now yours and removed from the shelter and you may leave a review of that shelter. As an admin you can add and remove shelters and approve adoption applications. As a shelter owner you may add and remove pets, but only at your shelter.
